#### What role does empathy play in your life and how has it helped you?
Depending on the environment, I can be introverted. I want to interact with the group but unsure how, so instead I observe. When someone in the group ask my opinion or how I'm doing I appreciate it. I feel valued, I feel noticed and want to contribute

#### How does empathy help you build better software?
When you're able to design products based on what the users want and need. And you know their wants and needs by actively listening to them and/or going out into the field and watching how they use the product.

#### Why is empathy important for working on a team?
When working on a team, you're working with people from different cultures, personalities and perspectives on the world. Hearing everyones opinion on the matter is important because they might see something that no one else sees or thought of. And making sure everyone in the team is heard is valuable. 

#### Describe a situation in which your ability to empathize with a colleague or teammate was helpful.
Knowing that I sometimes lean toward the introvert side, I push myself to speak up and call on my fellow introverters who we haven't heard from. I understand first hand that just because they haven't said anything doesn't mean they don't have anything to say.

#### When do you find it most difficult to be empathetic in professional settings? How can you improve your skills when faced with these scenarios? 
I struggle with people who always complain, people who are constantly playing the victim role and don't take responsibility for their actions/role. I can improve my skills by simply accepting them for who they are. Some people crave attention because they didn't get it as a child and its hard to see that when you have this ADULT infront of you constantly whinning. I've had times in my life when I blamed others for the situations I found myself in and I truly thought they were to blame and failed to realize the active role I played. But I was completely clueless to this fact. Just coming from a place of understanding.
